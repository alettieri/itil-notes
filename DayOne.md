# What is a Service?

Services are a means o fdelivering value to customers by facilitating the outcomes customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs and risks. 

> People want the service, they do not want to do it themselves

## Outcome
The reult (intended & actual) of an activity, process, or IT service. 

### Intended vs Actual

* What does good look like. What are we 'actually' delivering. 
* Outcome-based service definition helps with business-to-IT integration. 
* Promotes an internal dialogue on the meaning of services
* Customers want outcomes, but don't wish to have acountability or ownership of all the associated costs and risks

* Internal vs External Service Provider 

External also provides services, but those are usually services that can't be covered by the internal services. 

> We may not have the skillset to do a service, have an external service provider do the work
