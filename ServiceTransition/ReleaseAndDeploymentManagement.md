## Release and Deployment Management

Define and agree deployment plans

* Ensure integrity of release package
* Record and track all release packages in [Definitive Media Library (DML)](#definitive-media-library-dml)
* Manage stakeholders
* Check delivery of Utility and Warranty (Value)
* Manage risks
* Ensure knowledge transfer
* Package, build, test and deploy releases
* Establish services as described in Service Package

> ####### Definitive Media Library (DML)
 Records all of our software, licenses and documentation

## Concepts

### Release
Collection of hardware, software, documentation, processes or other components

> Not all releases are contained in DML or stored in DML. Software and Documentation would be stored in DML. 

### Release Unit
Components of an IT service that are normally released together

### Release Package/Release Design
One or more release units to upgrade from as-is to to-be situation

> Firm images are a good example

### Release Approaches

* Big Bang
	* Push out to everyone at once
* Phased
	* Push to small group of user base at a time
* Push
	* Administratively push changes
* Pull
	* Allow clients to pull changes
* Automation
	* Processing all of the above
* Manual
