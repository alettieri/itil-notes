## CSI Register

* **Should be regarded as part of the Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS)**

> CSI Register - Think of it as a suggestion box

* Introduce a structure and visibility to CSI ensuring that all initiatives are captured and recorded, and benefits realized
* The CSI register provides a coordinated, consistent view of the potentially numerous improvement activities
* The CSI manager should have accountability and responsibility for the production and maintenance of the CSI register 


## Models and Processes

* Continual Service Improvement Model
	* High Level of Continual Service Improvement

### CSI Model

0. What is the vision?
0. Where are we now?
0. Where do we want to be?
0. How do we get there?
0. Did we get there? &rarr; How do we keep it going?


## Seven Step Improvement

## From Vision to Measurement

&rarr; `Vision` &rarr; `Mission` &rarr; `Goals` &rarr; `Objectives` &rarr; `CSF` &rarr; `KPI` &rarr; `Metrics` &rarr; `Measurements &rarr;


## Metrics

* Key Performance Indicator
* Critical Success Factor
* Baselines

CSF has to be defined, what does the success or failure hinge on? 

Now we need to use KPI to monitor the CSF and measure

* CSF All improvement opportunities identified
	* KPI: % improvement in # of defects
* CSF The cost of providing services is reduced
	* KPI: % decreased in cost of service provision
* CSF Required business for all IT services are achieved
	* KPI Percentage increase in customer satisfaction

## Types of Metrics CSI monitors

* Technology
* Process
* Service metrics

## Activities

* Review management info
* Analyze trends
* Produce/Analyze SLA reports
* Conduct maturity assessments
* Conduct internal audits
* Customer satisfaction surveys
* Internal and external reviews

## Role

### CSI Manager
Responsible for the success of all improvement activities

* Define, monitor analyze and report on KPIS and CSFS
* Coordinate CSI activities

### Service Owner
* Accountable for a __specific__ service

## Interfaces

Interacts with all services and process owners and all other stages of the ITIL life-cycle

## Inputs and Outputs

CSI provides feedback to all Life cycle stages

## Interface with Service Level Management

* Service Level Management is critical to Continuous Service Improvement

## Risk Management

> Minimize Risk and Maximize Value

* Risk is _uncertain_ outcomes, whether positive or negative actions or events
