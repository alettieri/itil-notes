### Incident Models
_Standard_ or _specialized_ Incidents are handled in predefined path and within predefined timeframes

### Major Incidents
* The definition of Major Incidents should be agreed upon 
	* Incidents with high potential business impact
	* High urgency
	* Causes are known, with no current work-around available
* Separate procedure with shorter timeframes

## Process Activities

Sequence of Incident Reporting:

`Identification` &rarr; `Logging` &rarr; `Categorization` &rarr; `Prioritization` &rarr; `Initial Diagnosis` &rarr; `Investigation and Diagnosiss` &rarr; `Resolution and Recovery` &rarr; `Closure`

## Prioritization
