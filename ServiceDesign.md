# Service Design

* Design services to deliver more
* New
* New and Modified _processes_ 

> We're desigining Service and Process solutions

Processes:<a href="#processes"></a>

* [Design Coordination](#design-coordination)
* [Service Level Management](#service-level-management)
* Capacity Management -> Depends on [Demand Management](ServiceStrategy.md#demand-management)
* Availability Management
* IT Service Continuity Management 
* Information Security Management 
* Supplier Management
* Service Catalog Management -> Depends on [Service Portfolio Management](ServiceStrategy.md#service-portfolio-management)

## Service Design - Value to Business
* Improved alignment

> Final output of Service Design: __Service Design Package - SDP__
> Service Design builds the SDP

## Competence and Skills Framework

Right person for the job

### Skills Framewfork for the Information Age (SFIA)
Example of common reference model for the identification of the skills needed to develop effective IT Services.


## Process Owner
???

## Process Manager

* Plan and coordinate process activities
* activities are carried out as required
* appoint people
* Manage resources
* Work with service owners and other process managers
* Monitor and Report on Performance
* Identify improvements for Continous Service Integration
* Work with CSI manager and process owner to review and prioritize improvements
* Make improvements to process implementation

## Process Practictioner

Carries out the process

* Carrying out one or more activities
* Understand how role contribute to delivery
* Ensure that kick offs (inputs), outputs and interfaces (who is consulted/informed) for their activities are correct
* Creating or updating records to show that activities have been carried out correctly

## Service Portfolio and Catalog

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Service Pipeline</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Service Catalog</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Retired Services</td>
	</tr>
</table>


### Service Portfolio
* Contains information on all future requirements
User does not need details
Supports all processes

### Service Catalog
* Contains all details of operational services
* Subset of Service Portfolio
> Customer facing view of all services IT have in use

## Vital Business Function

VBF used to reflect the part of a business process that is critical to the success of the business

> VBF are determined by the business not by Service Provider

## Service Design Package

Defines a set of design constraints
Package is passed to -> Service Transition

Solution space is defined within constraints. 

## Design Coordination

> Keep all the plates [(processes)](#processes) spinning, make sure they're never dropped

## Design Coordination - Scope

Includes:

 Design Coordination Process
 All design activity
 new or changed service solutions designed for transition into environment

Does not Include:

* Responsibility for any activities or processes outside of the design stage
* Designing the detailed service solutions themselves of the production fo the individual parts of the SDPs. Individual Projects or srevices managenemnt are responsible for these.

## Service Design Aspects (On Test)

There are 5 Aspects of Design (On Test)

* Proccesses
* Technology & Architecture
* Measurement
* Service Management Systems
* Service Solutions


## Four Ps of Design

* People
* Products
* Processes
* Partners

## People
People skills and comptentencies involved in supplying IT services

## Products
Technology stack and management systems that deliver the IT service

## Processes
the processes, roles and activities involved in the provision of IT services

## Partners

The vendors, manufacturers and suppliers used to assist and support IT service provision.


## Technology and Architecture - Service Design

Tools used for:
* Hardware and Software design
* Environment design
* Process
* Data

Tools can assist by:
* Speeding up design process

* Ensure standards and conventions are followed
* Prototyping and modeling
* Validating designs


## Service Level Management

Ensure an _agreed upon_ level of all current IT services and future services are delvivered upon _achievable_ targets

* Service Level Requirements - SLR

* Service Level Agreement - SLA
Responsbilities of both parties. Emphasis must be on agreement. Are we achieveing the level of service we agreed upon with the customer?

* Operational Level Agreement - OLA

Is an agreement that your internal department will provide a level of agreement. Agreement between departments of the same organization.

* Underpinning Contract - UC

Service provider and external supplier agree on delivery of service. 

> Internet provider will provide internet service to web host provider

## Service Based SLA

### Service Based SLA
* Covers one service, for all customers of the service

### Cusotmer Based SLA
* SLA is an agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use

### Multi-Level SLA
* Corporate Level
* Customer Level
* Service Level

#### Corporate Level
Coversa ll the generic SLM issues appropriate to every customer in organziation

#### Customer Level
Covers all SLM issues relevant to particular customer group or busines unit, regardless of the service being used

#### Service Level
Covers all SLM issues relevant to the specific service, in relation to a specific customer group

### Producing SLRs

* Produced and Agreed Upon
* involve customer early
* Use for in-depth discussion with business
* Provisional targets may be included withi a pilot SLA


### Acitvities

* Determine, negotiate, document and agree upon requirements
* Monitor and measure SPA (Service Performance Achievemnets)
* Measure and improve customer satisfactin
* Service reports using SLAM charts SLA - Monitoring]

### Service Reviews

* Identify a trend
* Find Service targets not being met
* Find Degregation in service levels

> Postal service power supplies example. 

### Service Improvement Program (SIP)

All proccess and areas of service provider organization are involved

* If Service quality is adversely impacted, SLM must instigate an SIP to resotre service quality.
* Identify why service levels arent where they should be. How can we Improve them?

### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

Measure keys by number:

Objective Perspective:

* Percentage of service targets met
* Severity of service breaches
* Services with up-to-date SLAs
* Services with timely reports and active service 

Subjective Perspective:
* Improvements in customer satisfaction
* What can we do to make customers a little more happy

### Challenges

* Changing culture
* Representative that can help achieve the targets
* Service Desk Commitment
* Formulize and communicate agreement

### Role

Service Manager is responsible forj
* Achieve goals
* Awarness of business direction and needs (requirements)
* Consider requirements of customer

### Interfaces to SLM

* Incident management gets solution time from SLM
* Business Relationship Management gets business feedback and needs from customer
* Availability, Capacity, Continuit and Security Management all support SLM
