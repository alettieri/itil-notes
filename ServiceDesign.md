# Service Design

* Design services to deliver more
* New
* New and Modified _processes_ 

> We're desigining Service and Process solutions

Processes:<a href="#processes"></a>

* Service Level Management
* Capacity Management -> Depends on [Demand Management](ServiceStrategy.md#demand-management)
* Availability Management
* IT Service Continuity Management 
* Information Security Management 
* Supplier Management
* Service Catalog Management -> Depends on [Service Portfolio Management](ServiceStrategy.md#service-portfolio-management)
* Design Coordination

## Service Design - Value to Business
* Improved alignment

> Final output of Service Design: __Service Design Package - SDP__
> Service Design builds the SDP

## Competence and Skills Framework

Right person for the job

### Skills Framewfork for the Information Age (SFIA)
Example of common reference model for the identification of the skills needed to develop effective IT Services.

## Service Portfolio and Catalog

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Service Pipeline</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Service Catalog</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Retired Services</td>
	</tr>
</table>


### Service Portfolio

> Customer facing view of all services IT have in use

## Vital Business Function

VBF used to reflect the part of a business process that is critical to the success of the business

> VBF are determined by the business not by Service Provider

## Service Design Package

Defines a set of design constraints
Package is passed to -> Service Transition

Solution space is defined within constraints. 

## Design Coordination [(Processes)](#processes)

> Keep all the plates (processes) spinning, make sure they're never dropped

## Design Coordination - Scope

Includes:

 Design Coordination Process
 All design activity
 new or changed service solutions designed for transition into environment

Does not Include:

* Responsibility for any activities or processes outside of the design stage
* Designing the detailed service solutions themselves of the production fo the individual parts of the SDPs. Individual Projects or srevices managenemnt are responsible for these.

## Service Design Aspects (On Test)

There are 5 Aspects of Design (On Test)

* Proccesses
* Technology & Architecture
* Measurement
* Service Management Systems
* Service Solutions


## Four Ps of Design

* People
* Products
* Processes
* Partners

## People
People skills and comptentencies involved in supplying IT services

## Products
Technology stack and management systems that deliver the IT service

## Processes
the processes, roles and activities involved in the provision of IT services

## Partners

The vendors, manufacturers and suppliers used to assist and support IT service provision.


## Technology and Architecture - Service Design

Tools used for:
* Hardware and Software design
* Environment design
* Process
* Data

Tools can assist by:
* Speeding up design process

* Ensure standards and conventions are followed
* Prototyping and modeling
* Validating designs


## Service Level Management

Ensure an _agreed upon_ level of all current IT services and future services are delvivered upon _achievable_ targets

* Service Level Requirements - SLR

* Service Level Agreement - SLA
Responsbilities of both parties. Emphasis must be on agreement. Are we achieveing the level of service we agreed upon with the customer?

* Operational Level Agreement - OLA

Is an agreement that your internal department will provide a level of agreement. Agreement between departments of the same organization.

* Underpinning Contract - UC

Service provider and external supplier agree on delivery of service. 

> Internet provider will provide internet service to web host provider

## Service Based SLA

### Service Based SLA
* Covers one service, for all customers of the service

### Cusotmer Based SLA
* SLA is an agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use

### Multi-Level SLA
* Corporate Level
* Customer Level
* Service Level

#### Corporate Level
Coversa ll the generic SLM issues appropriate to every customer in organziation

#### Customer Level
Covers all SLM issues relevant to particular customer group or busines unit, regardless of the service being used

#### Service Level
Covers all SLM issues relevant to the specific service, in relation to a specific customer group
