#### Availability
#### Reliability

Availability is part of Reliability

> ###### Example
> I have a Car that I can drive (Availability); it's an old Car.
>
> Is the Car functional (Reliable)? 

#### Maintainability
* How quickly can I recover?
* Can I respond to issues and fix them, internally.

#### Serviceability
* External focus
* Is Windows XP going to service our needs? Microsoft is no longer servicing the platform, so NO.

#### Resiliency
* Is it redundant?

#### Security
* Is the availability of this service going to adhere to our service policies
* Vital Business Functions (VBFs)
