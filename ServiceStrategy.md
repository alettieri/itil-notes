## Competition and Marketspace

Service provider need to have a better understanding than the outside competition about the customer, market dynamics, and success factors of the market space. 

> Service Providers need to have a heads up on what's going on in the market and know our customer / internal business.

## Service Value

Two things make up service value: 

* Service Utility: What is the customer getting, what is the value our service
* Service Warranty: How the service is delivered, and it's stability: available, secure, coverage and continuity (is it ready for the future?).

__Utility__ + __Warranty__ = Value


## Value creation through Services

How will the service generate value for the organization? 

If the service does not provide real value, we can: modifiy, redesign or remove the service.

> Value created by meeting expectations
