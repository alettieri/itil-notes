## Service Value Definition - 76 - Test
__Service Value__ = Utility + Warranty

### Utility:

* Performance Supported?
* Constraints Removed?

### Warranty:

* Available enough ? 
* Capacity enough ? 
* Continuous enough ? 
* Secure enough ? 


Key ITIL Concepts:

## The Four Ps

### Perspective
The Distinctive vision and direction

### Position

## Competition and Market Space

There's always competition. 

Service provider need to have a better understanding than the outside competition about the customer, market dynamics, and success factors of the market space. 

> Service Providers need to have a heads up on what's going on in the market and know our customer / internal business.

## Service Value

Two things make up service value: 

* Service Utility: What is the customer getting, what is the value our service
* Service Warranty: How the service is delivered, and it's stability: available, secure, coverage and continuity (is it ready for the future?).

__Utility__ + __Warranty__ = Value


## Value creation through Services

How will the service generate value for the organization? 

If the service does not provide real value, we can: modify, redesign or remove the service.

> Value created by meeting expectations
